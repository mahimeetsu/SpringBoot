What is Spring Boot?
-------------------
  Spring Boot is opinionated Spring that reduces boilerplate configuration and helps bootstrap production-ready applications quickly.
But for me, the real value is not auto-configuration — it’s:
Embedded container (Tomcat/Jetty)
Externalized configuration
Production features like Actuator
Easy integration with Spring ecosystem
In one of our projects, we migrated from traditional Spring MVC with XML config to Spring Boot. That reduced deployment complexity and improved startup time by ~30%.

How Does Auto-Configuration Work?
----------------------------------
In Spring Boot, auto-configuration automatically sets up your application based on:
What’s on the classpath
What beans already exist
What’s defined in application.properties / application.yml
The current environment
It reduces the need for manual configuration.

When your Spring Boot app starts:

@SpringBootApplication is processed
Auto-configuration classes are loaded
Conditions are evaluated
Matching configurations are applied
Default beans are created (unless you override them)

Step-by-Step Internal Process
1️⃣ @SpringBootApplication Enables Auto-Configuration
@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyApp.class, args);
    }
}

@SpringBootApplication includes @EnableAutoConfiguration and That annotation triggers the entire auto-configuration mechanism.

Spring Boot Loads Auto-Configuration Classes
Spring Boot looks inside:META-INF/spring/org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.AutoConfiguration.imports
(Older versions used spring.factories.)

This file lists all auto-configuration classes like:
DataSourceAutoConfiguration
WebMvcAutoConfiguration
SecurityAutoConfiguration
Spring loads these classes automatically.

Conditional Evaluation (The Core Logic)

Each auto-configuration class is guarded by conditions like:
@ConditionalOnClass
@ConditionalOnMissingBean
@ConditionalOnProperty
@ConditionalOnWebApplication

Example:
@ConditionalOnClass(DataSource.class)
@ConditionalOnMissingBean(DataSource.class)

This means:
IF a DataSource class exists
AND the user has not defined one
THEN create a default DataSource

This is how Spring Boot avoids overriding your custom configuration.

Example: Web Application

If you add:spring-boot-starter-web

Spring Boot detects:
DispatcherServlet
Tomcat classes
Then it auto-configures:
Embedded Apache Tomcat
Spring MVC
JSON via Jackson
Default error handling
You write zero configuration.


Example: Database Auto-Configuration
If you add:
spring-boot-starter-data-jpa
Spring Boot checks:
Is DataSource on the classpath?
Are database properties defined?
Is JPA present?
If yes → it configures:
DataSource
EntityManager
TransactionManager
Hibernate
But if you define your own @Bean DataSource, Boot backs off.
That’s the key principle:
Auto-configure, but don’t override user configuration

🧠 The Back-Off Strategy
Spring Boot follows this rule:
If user defines it → use user bean
If user doesn't define it → create default bean
This is controlled mainly by:@ConditionalOnMissingBean




How does Spring Boot start internally?
-------------------------------------
main() Method Executes

Every Spring Boot app starts from:
@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyApp.class, args);
    }
}

The key entry point is:
SpringApplication.run(...)

This is where everything begins.

SpringApplication Is Created:
SpringApplication.run() does roughly this internally:
SpringApplication app = new SpringApplication(MyApp.class);
app.run(args);
During construction:
Determines WebApplicationType
SERVLET (Spring MVC)
REACTIVE (WebFlux)
NONE

Loads:
ApplicationContextInitializers
ApplicationListeners
Sets up default configuration

Application Run Lifecycle Begins
Inside run():

Step A: Prepare Environment
Creates Environment (StandardEnvironment or StandardServletEnvironment)
Loads:
application.properties / application.yml
Profile-specific configs
System properties
Environment variables
Resolves active profiles

Step B: Print Banner
Spring Boot prints the banner:
:: Spring Boot ::
(You can disable or customize it.)

Step C: Create ApplicationContext
Depending on the application type:
Type	Context Created
Servlet	AnnotationConfigServletWebServerApplicationContext
Reactive	AnnotationConfigReactiveWebServerApplicationContext
None
This is the core Spring IoC container.

Auto-Configuration Happens
This is the magic part.
Because of:
@SpringBootApplication

Which includes:
@Configuration
@EnableAutoConfiguration
@ComponentScan
🔹 @EnableAutoConfiguration

Triggers:
AutoConfigurationImportSelector
It:
Reads:
META-INF/spring/org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.AutoConfiguration.imports
Loads auto-configuration classes
Applies conditional annotations like:
@ConditionalOnClass
@ConditionalOnMissingBean
@ConditionalOnProperty

This is how:
Tomcat is configured
DataSource is created
Jackson is configured
Spring MVC is set up etc.

Embedded Server Starts (If Web App)
If it's a web application:
Spring Boot creates embedded server:
Tomcat (default)
Jetty
Undertow

Example:
TomcatWebServer.start()
The server binds to the configured port (default 8080).


Embedded Server Support in Spring Boot:
--------------------------------------
  Embedded server support means your application includes and runs a web server inside the same JVM process, instead of deploying your app to an external server.

So instead of:
Build WAR → Deploy to external Tomcat → Start Tomcat → Run app
You simply:
Run main() → Server starts automatically → App is ready

What Does “Embedded Server” Mean?

An embedded server is a web server packaged as a library (dependency) inside your application.
When your app starts:
Spring Boot creates the ApplicationContext
It creates and configures the web server
It starts the server automatically
It listens on a port (default: 8080)
All within the same process.
🌐 Supported Embedded Servers
Spring Boot supports:
Apache Tomcat (default)
Jetty
Undertow

How It Gets Added
When you include: spring-boot-starter-web,It automatically pulls in: spring-boot-starter-tomcat and Embedded Tomcat libraries
You don’t install Tomcat separately.

Embedded server support means your Spring Boot application contains and starts its own web server internally, eliminating the need for external deployment.
